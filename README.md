## About 📝
This website is a blog about the coding world where you need to pay a subscription to see the posts' full content.

## Technologies 💻
- It was developed using Typescript with NextJs and Sass to the front-end.
- I used FaunaDB as a database and Stripe to manage the subscription payment.
- Also, the content of the posts is written at Prismic so the application consumes it's API.
- And you can login into the site using GitHub OAuth, afterall it's a website with developers as his public.
